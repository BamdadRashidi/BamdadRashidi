# Hi there, you might seem to have bumped into the profile of mine. you might ask who even am i. well...

## Perhaps what i am, may not be the most important factor for now.

Don't fool yourself! because you have probably read my username. i am Bamdad. a computer engineer at SBU university in Iran.
I like making stuff and messing around with code.

Languages: C++, Java C#, GDscript, partial HTML + CSS and more to be added in the distant future.
